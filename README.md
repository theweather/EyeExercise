# Week 8: Eye Exercise

## So, what am I looking at here?

### This exercise was to take the one eye we were given and make a second eye that would also move along with the first one.

## How to Run This Project

### You can run this by forking this repo to your own GitHub, and loading index.html in your browser. Move your mouse around to see it in action!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

### Right now, there are no improvements planned for this particular code, but I may consider eventualy adding in code that makes the eyes move together but somewhat more independantly, because right now the eyes can't go cross-eyed.
